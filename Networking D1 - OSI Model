    Breaking up packets from higher MTU to lower MTU network
    Performed by routers
    MF flag is on from 1st until 2nd to last
    Offset is on from 2nd until the last
    Offset = (MTU - (IHL x 4)) ÷ 8

 uses RFC 3927
DHCP
  Will give an unkown IP an addres via DORA process
  uses RFC 1531

ICMPv4 Header
Contains a Type,Code,Checsum, and ICMP specific message

SOme ICMPv4 Types
0 - Echo Reply
3 - Destination Unreachable
5 - Redirect Message
8 -  Echo Request
11 -  Time exceeded

ICMPv4 TraceRoute
    Identifies hops between the source and destination
    Uses incrementing TTLs
    Hops return an ICMP Type 11 Time exceeded message when TTL reaches zero
    Continues until it reaches target or 30 hops*

    Can use various protocols and ports
        ICMP (windows default)
        UDP (linux default)
        TCP

    64-bit Interface ID (4 hextets)
    340 undecillian addresses
    Can Shorten Consecutive 0's with ::, can only be used once
Types:
  Unicast, Multicast,Anycast

IPv6 Fragmentation 
    IPv6 does not support fragmentation within it’s header

    Source adjusts MTU to avoid fragmentation
    Source can use IPv6 fragmentation extension header

Neighbor Discovery Protocol

    Routes traffic between Autonomous System (AS) Number
    Advertises IP CIDR address blocks
    Establishes Peer relationships
    Complicated configuration
    Complicated and slow path selection

BGP Operation
    How BGP chooses the best path:
        Advertise a more specific route. 192.168.1.0 /24 is more specific than 192.168.0.0 /16.
        Offer a shorter route to certain blocks of IP addresses.
        A route to ip prefix with 4 AS 'hops" is better than route with 5 AS 'hops'

BGP Hijack Defense
    IP prefix filtering

    BGP hijacking detection
        Tracking the change in TTL of incoming packets
        Increased Round Trip Time (RTT) which increases latency
        Monitoring misdirected traffic (change in AS path from tools like Looking Glass)

Layer 1 - Physical - Uses Bit

Contains Binary, Decimal, Hex, or even Base64
1 Hex digit is 1 nibble or 4 bits
Base64 uses (A-Z,a-z,0-9,+,/) (Uses = for a null valuse indicator)

Devices
Hubs
Repeaters - Pushes information further

Switches - Prevent Excessive Traffic
    Builds a MAC/CAM Table - CAM is Content Addressable Memory
      Learns by reading Source MAC addresses
    Forwards Frames
      Based on destination MAC Address
  Operation Modes:
    Cut-Through/Fast-forward: Only forwards to the destination
    Fragment-Free: Will read atleast 64 bytes of a message nefore forwarding
    Store-and-Forward: Accepts, and Analyzes message before forwarding

  CAM Table Overflow Attacks
    Frames are sent with fake MAC addresses to a switch. These address fill the table until no new MAC's can be learned.

Routers - Allow networks to communicate via routing tables.
