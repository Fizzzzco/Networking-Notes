NITH-M-006

OSI Model
Layers - Layer Name - Protocol Data Unit

Layer 7 - Application - Uses Data

Layer 6 - Presentation - Uses Data

Layer 5 - Session - Uses Data

Layer 4 - Transport - Uses Segment/Datagram

Layer 3 - Network - Uses Packets

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Layer 2 - Data Link - Uses Frames
LAN Technologies (IEEE Standards)
Ethernet 802.3
Wireless 802.11
Token Ring 802.5

VLAN Types
  Default - VLAN 1
  Data - User Traffic
  Voice - VOIP traffic
  Management - Switch and router management
  Native - Untagged switch and router traffic
VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)

Dynamic Trunking Protocol(DTP)
  Cisco Proprietary protocol
  2 Modes
  Dynamic-Auto - Will automatically look for trunking and change if needed
  Dynamic-Desirable 

CDP,FDP,LLDP
Cisco Discovery Protocol
Foundry Discovery Protocol
Link Layer Discovery Protocol

Frame Headers
  Ethernet Header
    MAC Header
      Contains Destination MAC (First 6 bytes), Source MAC (Second 6 bytes), and Ethertype (Last 2 bytes)
                                                                      0800 - IPv4, 0806 - ARP, 86DD - IPv6, 8100 VLAN Tag
  ARP Header
    In order the header reads
      Hardware type, protocol type, Hardware Address Length, Protocol Address Length, Operation, Sender HW addressm Sender Protocoll Address, Target HW address, Tgt Protocol Address
  ARP Type
    ARP (OP 1 and 2_
    RARP (Reverse Arp)[OP 3 and 4]
    Proxy ARP (OP 2)
    Gratuitous ARP (OP 2)

  802.1Q Header
    Same as Mac header above, however it adds 4 bytes (VLAN TAG) between the source mac and ethertype. Starts with 8100
  802.1D Header
    Same as 802.1Q, however it adds another VLAN Tag between the source and another VLAN tag. This new tag starts with 88A8

Sub Layers
MAC - Medium Access Control
    2 parts of a MAC
    OUI - First 24-bits Specified by IANA
    NIC - Last 24-bits specified by Vendor

  Address Types
    Unicast: One to One
      8th bit is off
    Multicast: One to many
      8th bit is on
    Broadcast: One to all
      All bits on
  
LLC - Logical Link Control
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Layer 1 - Physical - Uses Bit

Contains Binary, Decimal, Hex, or even Base64
1 Hex digit is 1 nibble or 4 bits
Base64 uses (A-Z,a-z,0-9,+,/) (Uses = for a null valuse indicator)

Devices
Hubs
Repeaters - Pushes information further

Switches - Prevent Excessive Traffic
    Builds a MAC/CAM Table - CAM is Content Addressable Memory
      Learns by reading Source MAC addresses
    Forwards Frames
      Based on destination MAC Address
  Operation Modes:
    Cut-Through/Fast-forward: Only forwards to the destination
    Fragment-Free: Will read atleast 64 bytes of a message nefore forwarding
    Store-and-Forward: Accepts, and Analyzes message before forwarding

  CAM Table Overflow Attacks
    Frames are sent with fake MAC addresses to a switch. These address fill the table until no new MAC's can be learned.

Routers - Allow networks to communicate via routing tables.
