        In-Line
            Test Access Point (TAP)
                Appliance placed between 2 network devices
                Best for packet collection with no data loss
                Must be placed "in line" of network traffic
                Not Scalable
                Will need several installed to capture traffic for other network segments
            Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
                Attacker can use ARP or some other method/protocol
                Attackers can sniff or manipulate traffic that flows through them
                Typically must be on the same network as the victim
                Traffic capture is dependent on the attacker’s system and bandwidth
            Placed between communicating devices to stop attacks
            Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
            Firewall
            Impacts network latency

        Out of Band (Passive)
            Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN)
                Configured on the network Switch
                Best for packet collection of traffic from several switch ports at once
                Scalable
                Can have a high degree of packet loss
                Places burden on the network Switch
            Monitors network segments
            Can detect attacks but cannot stop them
            Gets copies of network traffic
              Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
            Does not impact network latency

Identify Default Characteristics
Finger Printitng/Host Identifying
  Fingerprinting
    Active OS fingerprinting
        Easier
        Send packets to the target and monitor response
        Tools:
            Nmap
            Xprobe2
            sinfp3
      Passive OS fingerprinting
        More difficult
        Rely on sniffing packets
        Tools:
            p0f
              Looks at variations in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
              Configuration stored in: /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
            Ettercap

Network Traffic Baselining
  Perform  Baselining
      Preparation:
        Network Diagram
        Known Servers, Hosts, and Networking devices
        Known IPs, ports, and protocols
        Known forbidden IPs, ports, and protocols
        Known traffic "flows"
      Scope and Objectives:
        What traffic/protocols to capture?
        Which network segments?
        Which days?
        What times?

Indicators
  Anomaly Detections
      Indicator of Attack (IOA)
        Proactive
        A series of actions that are suspicious together
        Focus on Intent
        Looks for what must happen
            Code execution. persistence, lateral movement, etc.
      Signs
        Destination IP/Ports
        Public Servers/DMZs
        Off-Hours
        Network Scans
        Alarm Events
        Malware Reinfection
        Remote logins
        High amounts of some protocols

      Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
        Reactive
        Forensic Evidence
        Provides Information that can change
            Malware, IP addresses, exploits, signatures
        Signs
          Unusual traffic outbound
          Anomalous user login or account use
          Size of responses for HTML
          High number of requests for the same files
          Using non-standard ports/ application-port mismatch
          Writing changes to the registry/system files
          Unexpected/unusual patching or tasks


        Some Indicators
          .exe/executable files
          NOP sled
          Repeated Letters
          Well Known Signatures
          Mismatched Protocols
          Unusual traffic
          Large amounts of traffic/ unusual times

Anomalies through traffic analysis
ICMP Tunneling
    ICMP PING uses Type 8 and Type 0
    Both should be:
        1 for 1
        Same size and payload
    Look out for:
        Request/Reply imbalances
        Abnormal/different payloads

DNS Tunneling
    DNS uses Query/Response
        1 Query typically gets 1 response
    Look out for:
        Query/Response imbalances
        Abnormal/different payloads
        Continuous Queries

HTTP(S) Tunneling
    HTTP is "bursty" in nature
    Client issues request and the server responds
    Look out for:
        Steady connections
        HTTPs you will need to check session establishment for abnormalities

Beaconing
    Call back to the C&C server
    Gets/sends commands from/to C&C
    Look out for:
        Beacon Timing
            Commonly at regular intervals
        Beacon Size
            Check-Ins may not have any payloads
            Orders will have payloads
